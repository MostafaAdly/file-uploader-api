# file-uploader-api
This is a personal api i made to help my other projects in file managing.


NOTE:

This project standing alone does not seem impressive, but with my other project that this was working in it was a good quality/time improvement for the whole user experience.
By saying other projects i mean, the projects uploaded in the other respositeries of my account, such as discordbots/ google classroom, whatsapp api, tawbah java backend, etc.
